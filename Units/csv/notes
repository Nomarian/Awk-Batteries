maybe have a full blown parser, but use -v to set the options?
-v headers++
-v mysplit++
options: headers, mysplit, simplesplit, equivalencycheck, 

For a correct csv parser (as indicated by RFC)
 cat (headers headers-nf check split verify-nf-headers)^.awk > csv.awk

You can keep removing and using other fields for leniency
