Translation of the basic Unix toolkit in awk

Simple/
	Portable and often naive approach

Modules/
	Functions and variables you can source from

Commands/
	each command is a directory containing the command
	extension .test are tests the command must pass
	 If there are too many tests, they will be in a test/ directory
	each extension corresponds to its interpreter
	.gawk is gawk specific
	.bawk is busybox awk
	.oawk is old/original awk
	.mawk is mawk
	.rawk is runawk
	.shawk is a shellscript wrapper
	.awk is portable across all

Shortest/
	Shortest Implementation of Unix commands

POSIX/
	Tries to adhere to POSIX as much as possible

RSFS/
	Shortest Implementation but inherits RS or FS if set in ENVIRON

Units/
	Sourceable code you can import but is not that stable
